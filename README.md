# Moisture-Sensitive Fe2O3 Nanoparticle-Based Magnetic Soft Actuators
Multifunctional soft robots are emerging as a new-generation intelligent device for challenging environments. To meet the requirements of smart applications and soft robotics, developing a soft actuator capable of multiple functions and mechanical deformation is essential. In this study, we designed a free-standing magnetic soft actuator constructed from iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), that responds to both moisture and magnetic fields. We used computational modeling (density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics) to explain the experimental findings demonstrating the deformation and high-bending angle (∼150°), which is about twice as large under combined moisture and magnetic field exposure compared to their individual effect. Additionally, a flower-shaped soft robot was designed by using the continuous bending deformation of the actuator in response to moisture changes, performing directional bending in an ambient environment. These findings demonstrate the material’s sensitivity to moisture and magnetic fields, opening up new possibilities for designing responsive structures in the smart device industry.
